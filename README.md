# Stock-Market-Prediction_ARIMA_LSTM


we will work with historical data about the stock prices of a publicly listed company. We will implement a mix of machine learning algorithms to predict the future stock price of this company

We’ll be using a dataset from Quandl (you can find historical data for various stocks here) and for this particular project, I have used the data for ‘Tata Global Beverages’.
